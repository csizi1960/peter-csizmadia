<div class="bibref">H. J. Fowler and D. R. Archer, "Conflicting Signals of
Climatic Change in the Upper Indus Basin", Journal of Climate <b>19</b> (2006)
17, pp. 4276–4293.
<div class="bibquote">"Temperature data for seven instrumental records in the
Karakoram and Hindu Kush Mountains of the Upper Indus Basin (UIB) have been
analyzed for seasonal and annual trends over the period 1961–2000 and compared
with neighboring mountain regions and the Indian subcontinent. ... Winter mean
and maximum temperature show significant increases while mean and minimum
summer temperatures show consistent decline. ... Decreases of ~20% in summer
runoff in the rivers Hunza and Shyok are estimated to have resulted from the
observed 1°C fall in mean summer temperature since 1961, with even greater
reductions in spring months. The observed downward trend in summer temperature
and runoff is consistent with the observed thickening and expansion of
Karakoram glaciers, in contrast to widespread decay and retreat in the eastern
Himalayas."</div>

<div class="bibquote">"From the comparison of historical measurements and
photographs it is shown that the snout of Baltoro glacier is oscillating back
and forth a couple of hundred metres. Otherwise it seems not to react with the
same magnitude as other glaciers to the climatic change. Elevation changes at
Concordia are a few tens of metres at the most."</div>

<div class="bibquote">"Even though a considerable part of the Karakoram
glaciers have shown signs of glacier retreat, most of the longer glaciers
(&gt; 45 km), such as the Baltoro, Batura, Khurdopin glaciers have been rather
stagnant in the last century. ... However, many glaciers have mainly shrinked
by downwasting rather than by icefrontal recession. At the same time a lot of
glaciers, in particular the purely avalanche- fed glaciers, have shown
considerable high amounts of vertical changes of the glacier surface.  ... It
might be assumed that especially the longer Karakoram glaciers will react
delayed to a global temperature warming."</div>

Observations of Supra-Glacial Lake Fluctuations on the Baltoro Glacier,

</div>
<div class="bibquote">"Image analysis results show a significant increase in
the frequency and size of supraglacial lakes from 2000 to 2004. These results
support field observations that indicate that the Baltoro glacier is rapidly
downwasting. Break-out flooding also explains why the glacier does not exhibit
any terminal moraines."</div>
