<body>
When you close a browser window that contains an applet,
Netscape 4.51-4.7 (probably 4.06 and later) may freeze in MSWindows.
<font SIZE="+2">
<ol>
<li><a HREF="closefreeze-applet.html" TARGET="_blank">Click here to open the
    window.</a>
<li>Close the window.</li>
<li>Try again if you can (if Netscape did not freeze).</li>
</ol>
</font>
The browser usually freezes at the second try, but don't give up until the 20th.

Fortunately, there is a workaround: the applet must be put to sleep in
the <tt>destroy()</tt> method.

Previously, I had another workaround: I removed all the components
of the applet recursively in <tt>destroy()</tt> (see
<a HREF="CloseFreezeFix.java">CloseFreezeFix.java</a> and the
<a HREF="closefreezefix-applet.html" TARGET="_blank">test page</a>).
<a HREF="mailto:dkok@execpc.com">Dan Kok</a> pointed out that what Netscape
needs is probably just wasting some time. Putting the applet to sleep is a
more direct way to waste time than recursively removing its components.
