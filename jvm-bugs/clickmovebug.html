<title>Mouse DOWN/MOVE/DRAG bug in Windows</title>
</head>
<body>

In most MS WINDOWS platforms, the mouse DOWN and UP events are immediately
followed by MOVE and DRAG without reason.
Unix platforms do not seem to have this bug.
<p>
<ul>
<li>DOWN-&gt;DRAG, UP-&gt;MOVE in Netscape 2 and MSIE 3</li>
<li>UP-&gt;MOVE in Netscape 4 and MSIE 4</li>
</ul>
<p>
Click on the red canvas to test it.
<!-- Java Console shows all the mouse events, the text area on the right shows
only the ENTER, EXIT, DOWN, UP, and the buggy MOVE and DRAG events. -->
