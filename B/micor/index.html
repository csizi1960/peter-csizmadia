The <b>MI</b>croscopical <b>CO</b>alescence <b>R</b>ehadronization model
describes the creation of particles in 2-&gt;1 coalescence processes:
<ul>
<li>Meson resonances (1 spin: omega, rho, K<sup><small>*</small></sup>, phi)
    from quarks (u, d, s) and antiquarks.</li>
<li>Baryon resonances (3/2 spin: Delta, Sigma<sup><small>*</small></sup>, 
    Xi<sup><small>*</small></sup>, Omega) from <em>diquarks</em> and quarks.
    </li>
<li>Antibaryon resonances from antidiquarks and antiquarks.</li>
<li>Diquarks are created like the mesons, but from two quarks.
    The <em>coalescence factor</em> of diquark creation is twice the
    coalescence factor for the corresponding meson.
    The factor 2 comes from the colors
    (diquarks are colorful, mesons are colorless).</li>
</ul>
Lower mass hadrons (protons, pions, etc.) cannot be created in the
coalescence model because quarks have (large)
<em>constituent quark masses</em>.
These hadrons are produced later, when the resonances decay.
In the original version of MICOR, decays were simulated using the JETSET event
generator. In later versions, our hadronic cascade program, GROMIT is used,
which is also able to simulate final state interactions.
